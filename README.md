MIDI files &amp; mp3s for vocal training

This is a small, but hopefully useful collection of MIDI files, mp3s, plus project files, to help people with vocal training

Vocal training can be hard to find, plus if you didn't want to use online sources all the time & want to be in control of how you train.<br>
I could not find any training MIDI that could help myself with my own vocal training journey. So I made this, with huge additions many courses don't have. These were made through ear training & hearing what is played & going with what feels & hears correct

The project files were made in Logic Pro X. But the MIDI files can be used in any type of DAW. There is also a series of mp3s at certain speeds to help you train your voice. Easy to put on your phone or any other device for your leisure

This is not perfect. But it's something to get you started on your path of vocal training

A big shout out to [Roma Waterman](https://www.romawaterman.com). She was the main inspiration for this, as well as a few other videos I've seen. I have a few of her courses from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/romawaterman), she is a great teacher & explains a lot

By all means use these to help yourself & even do some additions to them with pull requests, if you feel it will help

All the best & happy singing
