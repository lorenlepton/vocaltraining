MIDI files &amp; mp3s for vocal training

This is a small, but hopefully useful collection of MIDI files, mp3s, plus project files, to help people with vocal training

Vocal training can be hard to find, plus if you didn't want to use online sources all the time & want to be in control of how you train

The project files werte made in Logic Pro X. But the MIDI files can be used in any type of DAW. There is also a series of mp3s at certain speeds to help you train your voice. Easy to put on your phone or any other device for your leisure

By all means use these to help yoursaelf & even do some additions to them with pull requests, if you feel it will help

This is not perfect. But it's something to get you started on your path of vocal training

All the best & happy singing
